# Convex-Lens-Simulation-with-Ray-Tracing
In this project, we have created a convex lens simulation with ray tracing using JavaFX. This simulation will demonstrate how light rays pass through a convex lens and create a spot diagram.
🔭 Convex Lens Simulation with Ray Tracing

​A JavaFX application designed to simulate how light rays interact with a convex lens using fundamental principles of geometric optics. This project demonstrates ray tracing, refraction via Snell's Law, and the generation of a visual spot diagram.

​🎯 Project Objective​The goal of this simulation is to provide a valuable educational tool for optics and physics.It allows users to visualize and understand the behavior of light rays as they pass through a convex lens, confirming theoretical principles with adjustable parameters.

​✨ Features​

Adjustable Parameters: Users can input the Focal Length and Aperture Diameter of the convex lens.
​

Ray Tracing Simulation: Simulates light rays passing through the lens, showing the path of the incident and refracted rays.
​

Physics-Based Refraction: Light rays are refracted according to Snell's Law as they pass through the lens.
​

Spot Diagram Generation: Creates a graphical representation (ScatterChart) showing the convergence point of the refracted rays, which is essential for understanding lens behavior and aberrations.​JavaFX GUI: Built using JavaFX for a robust graphical user interface.
​Technical implementation

Component Technology / Concept Used Rationale Java Used for backend logic and application framework-- GUI Framework JavaFX

Core Physics Used to calculate the refractedAngle as light passes through the assumed lens material (refractive index n=1.5)-- Snell's Law

Visualization JavaFX Line and ScatterChart -- Used to draw the light paths and generate the spot diagram.

🚀 Getting Started

​Prerequisites​🌟Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

🌟An IDE supporting JavaFX (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

🌀​ Running the Simulation

1.Clone the repository

2.Navigate to the ConvexLensSimulation.java file (or the relevant project directory).

3.Run the main application class: ConvexLensSimulation.

4.An input window will appear, allowing you to set the Focal Length (mm) and Aperture Diameter (mm).

5.Click "Simulate Lens" to open two separate windows: the Ray Diagram simulation and the Spot Diagram.

🖼️ Sample Output​The application generates two main visual outputs upon simulation:​

🌟Ray Diagram: Shows parallel incident rays converging after passing through the convex lens.

​🌟Spot Diagram: A scatter chart illustrating the points where the refracted rays converge.
